      question: "Explain the theory of relativity.",
      answer: "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, includes the special and general theory of relativity. The special theory of relativity deals with physics in the absence of gravity and is based on two postulates: the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another, and the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or the motion of the light source. The general theory of relativity extends these concepts to include gravity as a property of the geometry of space and time, or spacetime."

      question: "What are the main drivers of climate change?",
      answer: "The main drivers of climate change are greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for energy and transportation, which release carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into Earth's atmosphere. Deforestation, industrial processes, and some agricultural practices also contribute to these emissions. These activities increase the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and resulting in changes to global climate patterns."

      question: "Describe the process of photosynthesis.",
      answer: "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, a sugar. During photosynthesis, these organisms use sunlight to transform water and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. The general equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2. This process occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain chlorophyll that captures light energy. Photosynthesis is vital for life on Earth as it provides oxygen for respiration and organic compounds that form the basis of the food chain."
